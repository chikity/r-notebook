## Operators

### Custom 'NOT IN' Operator

R has a built in `%in%` operator that's useful for comparing values that's similar to SQL's `LIKE` operator.  However, it doesn't have a built in `NOT LIKE` operator like SQL does which is useful in some cases.

```{r}
# Defining the operator

`%!in%` <- Negate(`%in%`)
```

Example:

```{r}
fav_fruits <- c('apple', 'oranges', 'bananas', 'grape')
shopping_list <- c('bananas', 'persimmon', 'peach', 'apple', 'custard apple')

# Normal `%in%` operator use
fav_fruits[fav_fruits %in% shopping_list]
```
Above we can see two of our favorite fruits being on the shopping list

Next, using the custom defined `%!in%` operator
```{r}
# Favorite fruits not being bought

fav_fruits[fav_fruits %!in% shopping_list]
```
```{r}
# Not so favorite fruits being bought :(

shopping_list[shopping_list %!in% fav_fruits]
```
